üöß Under Construction üöß

An ultralight package to stash useful radiometric decay constants for geochronology and cosmochronology, along with useful decay and ingrowth equations. 

To add Decay.jl to your Julia environment, just type `]` into the Julia REPL to enter the built-in package manager and then type `add https://github.com/grahamedwards/Decay.jl` and hit enter.

After installing, you can load the package with `using Decay`.

Decay only exports a NamedTuple `Œª`, which contains decay constants. Within the package scope, there are a few helpful equations: `D`,`D_`, `N`, `lambda`, and `halflife`. Check out the documentation to learn more. 

I will continue adding to these as free-time permits üòµ‚Äçüí´
