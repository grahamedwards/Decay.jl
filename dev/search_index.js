To call the 1σ uncertainty (standard error of the mean), give the same value with a σ prefix, as in λ.σU238.\n\nIn most cases, I try to cite the original publications containing accepted measurements. In a few cases, I use compilations from reviews. \n\nisotope(s) reference doi note\n²³⁸U, ²³⁵U Jaffey+ 1991 10.1103/PhysRevC.4.1889 \n²³²Th Holden 1990 10.1351/pac199062050941 [1]\n²³⁴U, ²³⁰Th Cheng+ 2013 10.1016/j.epsl.2013.04.006 \n²²⁶Ra Holden 1990 10.1351/pac199062050941 \n⁴⁰K Renne+ 2011 10.1016/j.gca.2011.06.021 [2]\n\n[1] This value is similar to the often-used value of Le Roux & Glendenin 1963 (1.40 ± 0.007 Gy).
